# VigenereCipher

VigenereCipher class written for Python2 and Python3.  It was written in both due to the differences in encoding/decoding between Python2 and Python3.  The addition of encoding/decoding functionality allows the cipher to work with multiple alphabets and therefore multiple languages outside of that represented by the ascii system.  Remember, you can always leave/add additional characters to an alphabet to increase the complexity of the cipher.

The cipher was originally developed by itialian cryptographer Giovan Battista Bellaso.  Also dubbed "the indecipherable cipher."
